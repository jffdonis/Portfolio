This is the popular snake game, it was created using pygame. All you need to do is move the snake around using 
the arrow keys and eat the apple that generates randomly. Once the snake eats the apple it gets bigger and it moves faster.
Avoid touching the borders of the screen and your own body, if you do the game is over!
